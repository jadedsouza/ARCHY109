Hi! Welcome to my application that I've made using
HTML & R. I thought it would be fun to make Madlibs of 6-8 sentences for the
themes that we've explored in class, using code. <br>
I decided to touch upon 3 of the most prevalent themes in my opinion: <br>
1) Danger being released through archaeology <br>
2) Cultural Difference <br>
3) Non progress <br>
This application is
interactive. Do keep in mind that the first MadLib that will pop up
on the screen is a default, but will change depending on choices of
words from the panel on your left that you choose to put in!

If you're interested in the code that I wrote, here's my github repository"
