       Hi! Welcome to my application that I've made using 
       HTML & R. I thought it would be fun to make Madlibs of 6-8 sentences for the
       themes that we've explored in class, using code. <br>
       I decided to touch upon 3 of the most prevalent themes in my opinion: <br>
       1) Danger being released through archaeology <br>  
       2) Cultural Difference <br>
       3) Non progress <br>
       This application is 
       interactive. Do keep in mind that the first MadLib that will pop up
       on the screen is a default, but will change depending on choices of
       words from the panel on your left that you choose to put in!
       <br>
       <br>
       If you're interested in the code that I wrote, here's my github repository"

       It was really wonderful taking this class, and learning more about archaeology.
       It's become increasingly apparent to me now that it's been skewed and portrayed 
       exceptionally incorrectly in movies, especially in those from the early 2000's. <br>
       I'm pretty sure that I'm going to be one of those people that comment on how obnoxious
       and inaccurately archaeologists in movies are portrayed now!
